# Exercise 3 - Create Category Management Dashboard on SAP Analytics Cloud

This exercise will focus on using the views created in a previous exercise to create rich Category Management reports in SAP Analytics Cloud. By integrating these data sources, the reports will allow for powerful data analysis and visualization of the sales performance of different product categories. The information gathered from these reports can be used to make informed decisions about product assortment, pricing, and promotions. The use of Big Query and SAP source systems will ensure that the data used in these reports is accurate, up-to-date, and consistent, providing a solid foundation for effective Category Management decision-making.
